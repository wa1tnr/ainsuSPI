Unsupported Ports
==============================

Adafruit's MicroPython derivative currently has limited support with a focus on
the Atmel SAMD21 port. The ports below still exist in the code to preserve
upstream compatibility but are not tested. Use at your own risk.

We recommend using `upstream MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_ for the below ports.
